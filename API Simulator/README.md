# Interrupt Simulator

## Overview
This project simulates an interrupt handling system, designed to manage programs and their system calls. It includes the main simulation logic, definitions for handling interrupts, and associated data structures.

## Files
- **interrupts.cpp**: Contains the implementation of the interrupt handling mechanisms.
- **interrupts.hpp**: Header file defining the structures and functions used for handling interrupts.
- **simulator**: An executable file generated by compiling `interrupts.cpp`.
- **test1.sh**: A shell script to compile and run the simulator with provided input files.
- **vector_table1.txt**: Contains hexadecimal addresses used for interrupt handling.
- **external_files.txt**: Maps programs to their memory sizes or other relevant parameters.
- **program1.txt**: Specifies the CPU cycle information for a program.
- **program2.txt**: Contains a system call and its associated value.
- **system_status.txt**: Logs the system's status, including programs loaded into memory and their partitions.

## Running the Simulator
1. Make `test1.sh` executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x test1.sh
   ```
2. Execute the script to compile and run the simulator:
   ```bash
   ./test1.sh
   ```
   This command compiles `interrupts.cpp` and runs the simulator with input files `trace.txt`, `external_files.txt`, `vector_table1.txt`, and outputs to `output.txt`.

## Input Files Explained
1. **vector_table1.txt**: Lists hexadecimal addresses that represent interrupt vector entries.
2. **external_files.txt**: Specifies program names and sizes in the format: `program_name, size`.
3. **program1.txt**: Details CPU usage in cycles, with `CPU, 100` indicating 100 cycles.
4. **program2.txt**: Defines a system call in the format `SYSCALL id, value`.

## System Status Logging
The `system_status.txt` file tracks the system state at various time intervals, displaying:
- **PID**: Process ID.
- **Program Name**: The name of the running program.
- **Partition**: The memory partition assigned to the program.
- **Size**: The memory size allocated.

Each entry shows how programs are loaded into memory, with updates at different save times.

## Compilation and Execution
The simulation compiles using `g++`:
```bash
g++ interrupts.cpp -o simulator
```
And is executed as:
```bash
./simulator trace.txt external_files.txt vector_table1.txt output.txt
```

## Notes
- Ensure all input files are correctly formatted and available in the same directory as the executable.
- Modify `trace.txt` and `output.txt` paths as needed for custom test cases.
